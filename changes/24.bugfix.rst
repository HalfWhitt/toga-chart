The requirements of ``toga-chart`` were modified so that toga-chart is only dependent on ``toga-core``, rather than the ``toga`` meta-package. This makes it possible to install ``toga-chart`` on Android, as the meta-package no longer attempts to install the ``toga-gtk`` backend on Android; but it requires that end-users explicitly specify ``toga`` or an explicit backend in their own app requirements.
